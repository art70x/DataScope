Thank you for considering contributing to DataScope! 🎉
Your contributions, whether big or small, are essential to the success of this project. We welcome **bug reports**, **feature requests**, **documentation updates**, and **code improvements**.

## Contribution Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [DataScope repository](https://github.com/art70x/DataScope).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/art70x/DataScope.git
cd DataScope
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure everything is working by running the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name based on your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Examples:

- `fix-typo-in-readme`
- `feature-add-dark-mode`
- `enhance-error-handling`

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

- Update the code, fix bugs, or implement new features in the `src` folder.
- Ensure your changes:
  - Are properly documented.
  - Adhere to coding best practices and project conventions.
  - Are accompanied by relevant test cases, if applicable.

### Step 6: Build the Project

After making your changes, rebuild the project to generate updated files:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 7: Test Your Changes

- Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected.
- Use the local development server (`npm run dev`) to verify functionality.
- If applicable, run automated tests to confirm your changes don’t break existing functionality.

### Step 8: Commit Your Work

Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add dark mode toggle"

- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `style`: Code style changes (non-functional)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests

### Step 9: Push and Submit a Pull Request

Then, navigate to the **original DataScope repository** and submit a pull request.
Include the following in your PR description:

- A summary of changes.
- Related issue IDs (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Screenshots or videos (if applicable).
